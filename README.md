## 📌 Overview  
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing crime data from 2020 onward.  
It aims to explore trends, seasonal patterns, and correlations with economic/demographic factors.

## 📊 Research Questions  
1️⃣ What are the overall crime trends from 2020 onward?  
2️⃣ What seasonal patterns exist in the crime data?  
3️⃣ What is the most common crime type, and how has it changed over time?  
4️⃣ Are there regional differences in crime rates?  
5️⃣ How do economic factors correlate with crime rates?  
6️⃣ What is the relationship between the day of the week and crime frequency?  
7️⃣ Did major events or policy changes impact crime rates?  
8️⃣ Are there any outliers or anomalies in the dataset?  
9️⃣ Do demographic factors (e.g., age, gender) influence crime patterns?  
🔟 Can we predict future crime trends using machine learning models?

## 🔍 Methodology  
- **📥 Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, removed duplicates, converted data types  
- **📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualized trends, regional differences, and seasonality  
- **📉 Advanced Analysis:** Used predictive modeling (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to forecast crime trends

## 🚀 Future Work  
✅ Expand analysis with more economic/demographic data  
✅ Improve predictive modeling with external datasets  
✅ Develop an interactive dashboard for visualization
